# EEL3744-LaTeX
A copy of my LaTeX package and class for microprocessor applications.
Currently, they use xelatex, but the geometry package that determines
the margins makes the compiler detect pdflatex as the driver.

####Update: 11/11/18, font choices now work for xelatex/xetex and pdflatex,
luatex not tested.
